@webpage{hpage,
	Abstract = {λPage is targeted at those haskell developers which also like to work with dynamic GUIs and wish to have something like Smalltalk's Workspace or jPage for Java. Using λPage developers can write haskell expressions, evaluate and test them, load, unload and (of course) reload modules and then, re-evaluate the same expressions. Developed over wxWidgets, λPage is multi-platform by nature and works in every scenario where ghc and wxWidgets work.},

@unpublished{vital,
	Abstract = {A documented-centered environment for Haskell, aimed at making the language 
accessible to a broad range of end users, is described. In this environment, Haskell 
modules are presented as documents with the values they define displayed in place 
textually or graphically (as `views'). An end user, who may have only a superficial 
knowledge of Haskell, is able to edit a program (for example, manipulating complex 
literal values of user-defined ADTs) by interacting with these views. The range of 
interactions possible (the `look and feel' of an ADT) is open-ended and is defined (by 
an expert user) in terms of Haskell type classes and implemented by a mechanism that 
employs a specialised form of reflection. 
A prototype version of this scheme has been implemented and significant design 
decisions (including the way that animation and external interactions are handled) are 
discussed.
