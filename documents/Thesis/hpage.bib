@unpublished{vital,
	Abstract = {A documented-centered environment for Haskell, aimed at making the language 
accessible to a broad range of end users, is described. In this environment, Haskell 
modules are presented as documents with the values they define displayed in place 
textually or graphically (as `views'). An end user, who may have only a superficial 
knowledge of Haskell, is able to edit a program (for example, manipulating complex 
literal values of user-defined ADTs) by interacting with these views. The range of 
interactions possible (the `look and feel' of an ADT) is open-ended and is defined (by 
an expert user) in terms of Haskell type classes and implemented by a mechanism that 
employs a specialised form of reflection. 
A prototype version of this scheme has been implemented and significant design 
decisions (including the way that animation and external interactions are handled) are 
discussed.
