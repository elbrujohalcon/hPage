Welcome to hPage!

-- INSTALL -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The easiest way to install hPage is through cabal-install:
1. Install wxWidgets 2.8.10 (or superior) from http://wxwidgets.org
2. Install Cabal from http://www.haskell.org/cabal/
3. Run $ sudo cabal install hpage
4. Run $ ~/.cabal/bin/hpage

-- USE -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To start using it, just write some haskell expressions separated by empty lines like the following ones:

12 + 30

length [0..41]

Now you can place your cursor on any of them and then press the [Value] or [Type] buttons to get their values or types
You can also type in Type names, like...

Int

IO

...to see their kind, using the [Kind] button

You can define functions, let's try out the well known fact...

fact x = foldl (*) 1 [1..x]

Now if you place your cursor on something like...

fact 20

... you can ask for its value or type

Also, instead of just placing your cursor on a expression, you can mark an area and hpage will evaluate just that area

That's just to start up... you can do some serious stuff with this application, just check out the different menues
